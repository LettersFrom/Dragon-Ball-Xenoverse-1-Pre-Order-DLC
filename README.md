# Dragon-Ball-Xenoverse-1-Pre-Order-DLC

Gives you access to the exclusive preorder dlc for the first Xenoverse game from 2015.

Please note that before starting your game you should be warned that your save file might be deleted so please make a backup before getting started.

To make this work, just take the codex.ini and the steam_api.dll and place them in your Xenoverse directory which will usually be in Steam\steamapps\common\DB Xenoverse.

If for whatever reason the file doesn't work before copying the two files over first rename your original steam_api.dll to steam_api_o.dll then transfer over the two file but only change the name of steam_api.dll if it doesn't work the first time.

The reason I put this on GitHub is because this verison doesn't have online support, so if anyone is able to find a fix for it they can easily post a fork for others to use.

Please be aware that this isn't the full game nor does this invoke the use of piracy, you will need a legal copy of the game from the Steam store.
